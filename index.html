			<h1>Name</h1>
			<p>My name is Le-Chuan Justin Chang, but I prefer to be called by my middle name, Justin.</p>
			<h1>Major and Year</h1>
			<p>I'm a Computer Science Major, in my Sophomore year (I am a Junior in terms of credits, however.)</p>
			<h1>Skill with Web Development</h1>
			<p>I'd give myself a 3, because I have experience with HTML, Javascript and CSS. I've also used some libraries for Javascript, like jQuery and Bootstrap. I'm rating myself so low because the boundary is really high (Facebook is a colossal amount of scripts, backend calls, and security features, to say the least), and I know there's a lot of stuff I don't know, like most Backend work. </p>
			<h1>Educational Goals</h1>
			<p>I didn't have many when I first entered the class, but since it was mentioned, I am interested in learning the MEAN stack, minus Angular, which likely is too
			advanced for the course, unfortunately.</p>
			<h1>Registering on Piazza</h1>
			<p>Yes, I have registered for Piazza.</p>
			<h1>Most interesting fact</h1>
			<p>I think the most interesting thing about me, at the current moment because I change my mind all the time, is that I have a tendancy to overanalyze or overthink questions. For instance: In the skill with web dev question, I spent about ten minutes thinking about it because I didn't know how to rate myself because Facebook is really big and hard to make, and I asked my brother who even stated no single person could possibly make Facebook. Also, I'm writing a slight rant at this question because it's really hard for me to quantify "most interesting" or "most unique". I might be being overly pedantic about these questions, yeah.</p>
