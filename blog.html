			<h1>Reflections on Assignment 0</h1>
			<h4>Challenges</h4>
			<p>Not counting answering the questions (You can read my ramble on it in index), I had a problem with my photo loading sideways for some reason. Turns out it was because it was too big, so I had to just shrink the image.</p>
			<h4>Learning</h4>
			<p>This was a fairly simply assignment, so I didn't need to do too much work. I did learn that images that are too big end up being rotated, however, though the threshold to do that seems to be really large, and if you're hitting it you should probably consider shrinking your image instead.</p>
			<h4>Resources</h4>
			<p>I used W3Schools and StackOverflow for some syntax, specifically, when my photo was too big and was rotating itself. Neither of those resources helped, either because they didn't mention image sizes where I looked or I wasn't looking in the right place, which is somewhat plausible since I looked for how to rotate an image, though I looked at W3School's img tag page. In the end, I just tried shrinking it and it fixed the issue.</p>
